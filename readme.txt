Embed Rich Context experiences on your site.

=== Description ===

This plugin is only used to embed experiences served up by Rich Context.

It has no other functionality and is only useful with a Configuration ID that is given by the company that instructed you to install this plugin.

If you are thinking of installing this plugin without a Configuration ID, you are welcome to but other than a pretty help area in the admin settings it's not going to do you any good.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/rich-context-experience-embed` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. Use the Settings->Rich Context screen to view the next steps

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
